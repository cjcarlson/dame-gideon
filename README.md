# Socioecological similarity predicts the global biogeography of infectious disease in humans

The goal of this project is to come up with a reasonable way to predict pathogen sharing patterns between countries, using the DAME (dynamic additive and multiplicative effects model) for dyadic networks.

This follows on two previous preprints: 
1. Poisot, T., Nunn, C., & Morand, S. (2014). Ongoing worldwide homogenization of human pathogens. [bioRxiv, 009977.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2014/10/03/009977.article-info)
2. Dallas, T. A., Carlson, C. J., & Poisot, T. (2018). Leveraging pathogen community distributions to understand outbreak and emergence potential. [bioRxiv, 336065.](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/08/03/336065)

The GIDEON data is available as a list of countries, years, and pathogens. The goal is currently to come up with appropriate dyadic predictors for pairs of countries. So far there are three categories that broadly include a few different ideas:

### Geographic predictors

1.

2.

3.

### Social predictors

1.

2.

3.

### Ecological predictors
